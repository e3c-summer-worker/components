# @e3c-summer-worker/homepage-ticker

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- NPM prepublish command didn't work and I didn't publish the build files oops.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- f7cf317: HOMEPAGE TICKER VERSION 2 RC1:

  - Huge backend changes (use webpack so I can have the banner), the debugging for elm-webpack-loader was horrendous
  - in reality, we just change homepage-ticker-elm.js to ticker.js
  - This also changes it so that we don't need to explicitly load elm in the header tag. I guess this is slightly easier.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Minify files

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Button looks better, added toggle b/w english and chinese
