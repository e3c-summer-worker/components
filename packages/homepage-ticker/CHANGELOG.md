## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- f7cf317: HOMEPAGE TICKER VERSION 2 RC1:

  - Huge backend changes (use webpack so I can have the banner), the debugging for elm-webpack-loader was horrendous
  - in reality, we just change homepage-ticker-elm.js to ticker.js
  - This also changes it so that we don't need to explicitly load elm in the header tag. I guess this is slightly easier.
