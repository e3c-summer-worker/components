# Scrolling Terrain

Based off of [p5-typescript-starter](https://github.com/Gaweph/p5-typescript-starter).

Note that we are using yarn workspaces, so the installations will be mostly consolidated at a top-level `node_modules/` folder.

## Run Locally

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

Then start a local server and go to index.html to see the results.

## Production

GIthub actions **will** be used to deploy to production. You can then access the files with jsdelivr on this link:
[https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/scrolling-terrain-bg@1.2.0/build/scrolling-terrain.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@e3c-summer-worker/scrolling-terrain-bg/build/scrolling-terrain.min.js).
