name: Update yarn dependencies

# this workflow updates the yarn deps whenever the GH actions bot
# pushes the new versions to the `changeset-release/main` branch
# This is so that we can update the dependencies.

# In the components repo, it usually won't be necessary to update lol
# In the Changeset Actions Test repo, the components rely on each other so this is more necessary
# https://github.com/e3c-summer-worker/changeset-actions-test
# I'm keeping it here tho, maybe we'll need it later
