            Well, you or the Changeset bot.

            Either way, when you merge this PR, **please squash it**!

            The only reason why you wouldn't squash is if you're going to actively continue working on the branch.
            In almost every case (such as `changeset-release/main` PRs, which get reset every time), you should squash.

            Thanks!
