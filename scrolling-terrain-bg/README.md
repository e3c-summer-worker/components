# Scrolling Terrain

Based off of [p5-typescript-starter](https://github.com/Gaweph/p5-typescript-starter)

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then start a local server and go to index.html to see the results.

## Production

Github actions should automatically compile the code and upload it to the `scrolling-terrain` branch where you can access it via a cdn.
I use [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) for this.

To access the latest file, you can use the following link:
You may want to lock a version number in production! Otherwise any pushes to `main` will overwrite the latest version.
