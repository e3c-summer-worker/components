# Scrolling Terrain

A scrolling terrain background heavily inspired by [this codepen](https://codepen.io/loktar00/pen/uEJKl).


## Implementation

Since this is the only `p5.js` drawing currently on the ECCC Kids website, I bundled `p5.min.js` with the output to reduce HTTP calls.
If there are more animations/drawings later on, this would be extremely impractical.
