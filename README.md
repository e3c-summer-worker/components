# Components

A list of components (written mostly using React or Elm) that I am using for the
website.

Most of the directions for running locally and implementing them remotely are in the respective folders.

Usually, the projects can be compiled into a single `.js` file which can then be moved to the `scripts/` folder in the [SummerWorkerECCC.github.io](https://github.com/SummerWorkerECCC/SummerWorkerECCC.github.io) repo.
