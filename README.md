# Components

A list of components (written mostly using React or Elm) that I am using for the
website.

Most of the directions for running locally and implementing them remotely are in the respective folders.

## Production

Most of the components have an associated Github Action that pushes it to a new branch, where you can then access it via a CDN, like jsDelivr (which is what I'm using primarily).

Some pages on Squarespace may still use jsDelivr links in the [SummerWorkerECCC.github.io](https://github.com/SummerWorkerECCC/SummerWorkerECCC.github.io) repository (I used to manually add the compiled code to the repo very time I made new changes), which I have kept there for backward compatibility.
