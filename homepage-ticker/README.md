# Homepage Ticker

Ticker for the home page, writen in Elm. Inspired by Rev. Doo, possibly implemented via [this thing](https://codepen.io/lewismcarey/pen/GJZVoG).

What it does is fetch the data from the deta micro server and display it in a simple HTML element.

It uses the deta micro server on the cloud, if you want to run it locally, you need to change the `url` in `src/HomepageTicker.elm`
to whatever you have the micro server running on (`http://localhost:3001` unless configured otherwise).
